# C++ Daily Practice

Welcome to my C++ Daily Practice repository! 

This repository is a testament to my journey of learning C++ from scratch. Each day, I will be pushing new code as I learn and grow my skills in C++. 

## What's Inside?

You'll find various directories corresponding to different topics I've explored in C++, ranging from basic syntax, data structures, algorithms, to more advanced concepts. Each directory will contain my practice code, along with comments explaining my thought process.

## Why C++?

C++ is a powerful language known for its performance and flexibility. It's widely used in game development, real-time systems, and high-performance computing - areas that I'm deeply interested in.

## My Goal

My goal is to become proficient in C++, enabling me to build efficient and performant applications. I believe that by practicing daily and documenting my progress, I can make consistent strides towards this goal.

Feel free to explore this repository, provide feedback, and learn alongside me. Happy coding!

# Learning C++ from scratch:

## **What is C++:**  
   C++ is a programming language that is used to create computer programs. It’s like a toolset that developers use to build software, similar to how a carpenter uses tools to build a house. It’s known for its speed and efficiency, and is commonly used in areas like video games and real-time systems.
   **Benefits of C++:**
     C++ has several benefits that make it a popular choice among programmers:

`Performance`: C++ is known for its efficiency and fast execution. It’s often chosen for applications where performance is critical.
`Compatibility with C`: Since C++ is an extension of C, it is highly compatible with C. If there is a valid C     application, it is compatible with C++.
`Object-Oriented Programming`: C++ supports object-oriented programming, which allows for better organization and     reusability of code.
`Low-Level Manipulation`: C++ allows for low-level programming tasks, like memory manipulation, which is necessary in   some cases.
`Large Community and Libraries`: C++ has a large and mature ecosystem of libraries and frameworks, which can be used to     accelerate development and simplify tasks.
`Portability`: Programs written in C++ can often be executed on other platforms without any modifications3.
    Use Cases: C++ finds a wide range of applications, including video games, operating systems, embedded systems, and real-time mathematical simulations.
