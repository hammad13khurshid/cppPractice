Summary of Concepts:

Data Types: This program demonstrates the use of various data types in C++. Data types define the type of data a variable can hold. The data types used in this program are string, int, float, double, char, and bool.
Variables: Variables are used to store data. In this program, variables are used to store details like name, age, height, weight, gender, and marital status.
Output: The cout statement is used to print the details stored in the variables to the console.
